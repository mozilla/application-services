# This file defines the metrics that will be gathered for the "logins"

# These are emitted for all users of the component.  Additional metrics

# package.
#
# Changes to these metrics require data review, which should take into
# consideration the following known consumers of the logins component
# Android bindings:

#  * Fenix for Andriod

  # These help us understand how much the logins store is being used, and
  # whether it's succeeding in the duties asked of it.  We'll use them to
  # graph e.g. the error rate of applications trying to use the logins store,
  # and identify application or platform features that lead to unusually
  # high error rates.
  read_query_count:
    type: counter
    description: >
      The total number of read operations performed on the logins store.
      The count only includes operations triggered by the application, not
      e.g. incidental reads performed as part of a sync. It is intended to be
      used together with `read_query_error_count` to measure the overall error
      rate of read operations on the logins store.
