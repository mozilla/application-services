# This file defines the metrics that will be gathered for the "logins"
# storage component.
# These are emitted for all users of the component.  Additional metrics
# specific to the *syncing* of logins are defined in a separate "sync_ping"
# package.
#
# Changes to these metrics require data review, which should take into
# consideration the following known consumers of the logins component
# Android bindings:

#  * Fenix for Andriod
