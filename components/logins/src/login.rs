//! # Login Structs
//!
//! This module defines a number of core structs for Logins. They are:
//! * [`LoginEntry`] A login entry by the user.  This includes the username/password, the site it
//!   was submitted to, etc.  [`LoginEntry`] does not store data specific to a DB record.
//! * [`Login`] - A [`LoginEntry`] plus DB record information.  This includes the GUID and metadata
//!   like time_last_used.
//! * [`EncryptedLogin`] -- A Login above with the username/password data encrypted.
//! * [`LoginFields`], [`SecureLoginFields`], [`LoginMeta`] -- These group the common fields in the
//!   structs above.
//!
//! Why so many structs for similar data?  Consider some common use cases in a hypothetical browser
//! (currently no browsers act exactly like this, although Fenix/android-components comes close):
//!
//! - User visits a page with a login form.
//!   - We inform the user if there are saved logins that can be autofilled.  We use the
//!     `LoginDb.get_by_base_domain()` which returns a `Vec<EncryptedLogin>`.  We don't decrypt the
//!     logins because we want to avoid requiring the encryption key at this point, which would
//!     force the user to authenticate.  Note: this is aspirational at this point, no actual
//!     implementations follow this flow.  Still, we want application-services to support it.
//!   - If the user chooses to autofill, we decrypt the logins into a `Vec<Login>`.  We need to
//!     decrypt at this point to display the username and autofill the password if they select one.
//!   - When the user selects a login, we can use the already decrypted data from `Login` to fill
//!     in the form.
//! - User chooses to save a login for autofilling later.
//!    - We present the user with a dialog that:
//!       - Displays a header that differentiates between different types of save: adding a new
//!         login, updating an existing login, filling in a blank username, etc.
//!       - Allows the user to tweak the username, in case we failed to detect the form field
//!         correctly.  This may affect which header should be shown.
//!    - Here we use `find_login_to_update()` which returns an `Option<Login>`.  Returning a login
//!      that has decrypted data avoids forcing the consumer code to decrypt the username again.
//!
//! # Login
//! This has the complete set of data about a login. Very closely related is the
//! "sync payload", defined in sync/payload.rs, which handles all aspects of the JSON serialization.
//! It contains the following fields:
//! - `meta`: A [`LoginMeta`] struct.
//! - fields: A [`LoginFields`] struct.
//! - sec_fields: A [`SecureLoginFields`] struct.
//!
//! # LoginEntry
//! The struct used to add or update logins. This has the plain-text version of the fields that are
//! stored encrypted, so almost all uses of an LoginEntry struct will also require the
//! encryption key to be known and passed in.    [LoginDB] methods that save data typically input
//! [LoginEntry] instances.  This allows the DB code to handle dupe-checking issues like
//! determining which login record should be updated for a newly submitted [LoginEntry].
//! It contains the following fields:
//! - fields: A [`LoginFields`] struct.
//! - sec_fields: A [`SecureLoginFields`] struct.
//!
//! # EncryptedLogin
//! Encrypted version of [`Login`].  [LoginDB] methods that return data typically return [EncryptedLogin]
//! this allows deferring decryption, and therefore user authentication, until the secure data is needed.
//! It contains the following fields
//! - `meta`: A [`LoginMeta`] struct.
//! - `fields`: A [`LoginFields`] struct.
//! - `sec_fields`: The secure fields as an encrypted string
//!
//! # SecureLoginFields
//! The struct used to hold the fields which are stored encrypted. It contains:
//! - username: A string.
//! - password: A string.
//!
//! # LoginFields
//!
//! The core set of fields, use by both [`Login`] and [`LoginEntry`]
//! It contains the following fields:
//!
//! - `origin`:  The origin at which this login can be used, as a string.
//!
//!   The login should only be used on sites that match this origin (for whatever definition
//!   of "matches" makes sense at the application level, e.g. eTLD+1 matching).
//!   This field is required, must be a valid origin in punycode format, and must not be
//!   set to the empty string.
//!
//!   Examples of valid `origin` values include:
//!   - "https://site.com"
//!   - "http://site.com:1234"
//!   - "ftp://ftp.site.com"
//!   - "moz-proxy://127.0.0.1:8888"
//!   - "chrome://MyLegacyExtension"
//!   - "file://"
//!   - "https://\[::1\]"
//!
//!   If invalid data is received in this field (either from the application, or via sync)
//!   then the logins store will attempt to coerce it into valid data by:
//!   - truncating full URLs to just their origin component, if it is not an opaque origin
//!   - converting values with non-ascii characters into punycode
//!
//!   **XXX TODO:**
//!   - Add a field with the original unicode versions of the URLs instead of punycode?
//!
//! - `sec_fields`: The `username` and `password` for the site, stored as a encrypted JSON
//!   representation of an `SecureLoginFields`.
//!
//!   This field is required and usually encrypted.  There are two different value types:
//!   - Plaintext empty string: Used for deleted records
//!   - Encrypted value: The credentials associated with the login.
//!
//! - `http_realm`:  The challenge string for HTTP Basic authentication, if any.
//!
//!   If present, the login should only be used in response to a HTTP Basic Auth
//!   challenge that specifies a matching realm. For legacy reasons this string may not
//!   contain null bytes, carriage returns or newlines.
//!
//!   If this field is set to the empty string, this indicates a wildcard match on realm.
//!
//!   This field must not be present if `form_action_origin` is set, since they indicate different types
//!   of login (HTTP-Auth based versus form-based). Exactly one of `http_realm` and `form_action_origin`
//!   must be present.
//!
//! - `form_action_origin`:  The target origin of forms in which this login can be used, if any, as a string.
//!
//!   If present, the login should only be used in forms whose target submission URL matches this origin.
//!   This field must be a valid origin or one of the following special cases:
//!   - An empty string, which is a wildcard match for any origin.
//!   - The single character ".", which is equivalent to the empty string
//!   - The string "javascript:", which matches any form with javascript target URL.
//!
//!   This field must not be present if `http_realm` is set, since they indicate different types of login
//!   (HTTP-Auth based versus form-based). Exactly one of `http_realm` and `form_action_origin` must be present.
//!
//!   If invalid data is received in this field (either from the application, or via sync) then the
//!   logins store will attempt to coerce it into valid data by:
//!   - truncating full URLs to just their origin component
//!   - converting origins with non-ascii characters into punycode
//!   - replacing invalid values with null if a valid 'http_realm' field is present
//!
//! - `username_field`:  The name of the form field into which the 'username' should be filled, if any.
//!
//!   This value is stored if provided by the application, but does not imply any restrictions on
//!   how the login may be used in practice. For legacy reasons this string may not contain null
//!   bytes, carriage returns or newlines. This field must be empty unless `form_action_origin` is set.
//!
//!   If invalid data is received in this field (either from the application, or via sync)
//!   then the logins store will attempt to coerce it into valid data by:
//!   - setting to the empty string if 'form_action_origin' is not present
//!
//! - `password_field`:  The name of the form field into which the 'password' should be filled, if any.
//!
//!   This value is stored if provided by the application, but does not imply any restrictions on
//!   how the login may be used in practice. For legacy reasons this string may not contain null
//!   bytes, carriage returns or newlines. This field must be empty unless `form_action_origin` is set.
//!
//!   If invalid data is received in this field (either from the application, or via sync)
//!   then the logins store will attempt to coerce it into valid data by:
//!   - setting to the empty string if 'form_action_origin' is not present
//!
//! # LoginMeta
//!
//! This contains data relating to the login database record -- both on the local instance and
//! synced to other browsers.
//! It contains the following fields:
//! - `id`:  A unique string identifier for this record.
//!
//!   Consumers may assume that `id` contains only "safe" ASCII characters but should otherwise
//!   treat this it as an opaque identifier. These are generated as needed.
//!
//! - `timesUsed`:  A lower bound on the number of times the password from this record has been used, as an integer.
//!
//!   Applications should use the `touch()` method of the logins store to indicate when a password
//!   has been used, and should ensure that they only count uses of the actual `password` field
//!   (so for example, copying the `password` field to the clipboard should count as a "use", but
//!   copying just the `username` field should not).
//!
//!   This number may not record uses that occurred on other devices, since some legacy
//!   sync clients do not record this information. It may be zero for records obtained
//!   via sync that have never been used locally.
//!
//!   When merging duplicate records, the two usage counts are summed.
//!
//!   This field is managed internally by the logins store by default and does not need to
//!   be set explicitly, although any application-provided value will be preserved when creating
//!   a new record.
//!
//!   If invalid data is received in this field (either from the application, or via sync)
//!   then the logins store will attempt to coerce it into valid data by:
//!   - replacing missing or negative values with 0
//!
//!   **XXX TODO:**
//!   - test that we prevent this counter from moving backwards.
//!   - test fixups of missing or negative values
//!   - test that we correctly merge dupes
//!
//! - `time_created`: An upper bound on the time of creation of this login, in integer milliseconds from the unix epoch.
//!
//!   This is an upper bound because some legacy sync clients do not record this information.
//!
//!   Note that this field is typically a timestamp taken from the local machine clock, so it
//!   may be wildly inaccurate if the client does not have an accurate clock.
//!
//!   This field is managed internally by the logins store by default and does not need to
//!   be set explicitly, although any application-provided value will be preserved when creating
//!   a new record.
//!
//!   When merging duplicate records, the smallest non-zero value is taken.
//!
//!   If invalid data is received in this field (either from the application, or via sync)
//!   then the logins store will attempt to coerce it into valid data by:
//!   - replacing missing or negative values with the current time
//!
//!   **XXX TODO:**
//!   - test that we prevent this timestamp from moving backwards.
//!   - test fixups of missing or negative values
//!   - test that we correctly merge dupes
//!
//! - `time_last_used`: A lower bound on the time of last use of this login, in integer milliseconds from the unix epoch.
//!
//!   This is a lower bound because some legacy sync clients do not record this information;
//!   in that case newer clients set `timeLastUsed` when they use the record for the first time.
//!
//!   Note that this field is typically a timestamp taken from the local machine clock, so it
//!   may be wildly inaccurate if the client does not have an accurate clock.
//!
//!   This field is managed internally by the logins store by default and does not need to
//!   be set explicitly, although any application-provided value will be preserved when creating
//!   a new record.
//!
//!   When merging duplicate records, the largest non-zero value is taken.
//!
//!   If invalid data is received in this field (either from the application, or via sync)
//!   then the logins store will attempt to coerce it into valid data by:
//!   - removing negative values
//!
//!   **XXX TODO:**
//!   - test that we prevent this timestamp from moving backwards.
//!   - test fixups of missing or negative values
//!   - test that we correctly merge dupes
//!
//! - `time_password_changed`: A lower bound on the time that the `password` field was last changed, in integer
//!   milliseconds from the unix epoch.
//!
//!   Changes to other fields (such as `username`) are not reflected in this timestamp.
//!   This is a lower bound because some legacy sync clients do not record this information;
//!   in that case newer clients set `time_password_changed` when they change the `password` field.
//!
//!   Note that this field is typically a timestamp taken from the local machine clock, so it
//!   may be wildly inaccurate if the client does not have an accurate clock.
//!
//!   This field is managed internally by the logins store by default and does not need to
//!   be set explicitly, although any application-provided value will be preserved when creating
//!   a new record.

//!   then the logins store will attempt to coerce it into valid data by:
//!   - removing negative values
//!
//!   **XXX TODO:**
//!   - test that we prevent this timestamp from moving backwards.
//!   - test that we don't set this for changes to other fields.
//!   - test that we correctly merge dupes
//!
//!
//! In order to deal with data from legacy clients in a robust way, it is necessary to be able to build
//! and manipulate all these `Login` structs that contain invalid data.  The non-encrypted structs
//! implement the `ValidateAndFixup` trait, providing the following methods which can be used by
//! callers to ensure that they're only working with valid records:
//!
//! - `Login::check_valid()`:    Checks validity of a login record, returning `()` if it is valid
//!   or an error if it is not.
//!
//! - `Login::fixup()`:   Returns either the existing login if it is valid, a clone with invalid fields
//!   fixed up if it was safe to do so, or an error if the login is irreparably invalid.
