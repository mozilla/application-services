//! Logins Schema v4
//! ================
//!
//! The schema we use is a evolution of the firefox-ios logins database format.
//! There are three tables:
//!
//! - `loginsL`: The local table.
//! - `loginsM`: The mirror table.
//! - `loginsSyncMeta`: The table used to to store various sync metadata.
//!
//! ## `loginsL`
//!
//! This stores local login information, also known as the "overlay".
//!
//! `loginsL` is essentially unchanged from firefox-ios, however note the
//! semantic change v4 makes to timestamp fields (which is explained in more
//! detail in the [COMMON_COLS] documentation).
//!
//! It is important to note that `loginsL` is not guaranteed to be present for
//! all records. Synced records may only exist in `loginsM` (although this is
//! not guaranteed). In either case, queries should read from both `loginsL` and
//! `loginsM`.
//!
//! ### `loginsL` Columns
//!
//! Contains all fields in [COMMON_COLS], as well as the following additional
//! columns:
//!
//! - `local_modified`: A millisecond local timestamp indicating when the record
//!   was changed locally, or NULL if the record has never been changed locally.
//!
//! - `is_deleted`: A boolean indicating whether or not this record is a
//!   tombstone.
//!
//! - `sync_status`: A `SyncStatus` enum value, one of
//!
//!     - `0` (`SyncStatus::Synced`): Indicating that the record has been synced
//!
//!     - `1` (`SyncStatus::Changed`): Indicating that the record should be
//!       has changed locally and is known to exist on the server.
//!
//!     - `2` (`SyncStatus::New`): Indicating that the record has never been
//!       synced, or we have been reset since the last time it synced.
//!
//! ## `loginsM`
//!
//! This stores server-side login information, also known as the "mirror".
//!
//! Like `loginsL`, `loginM` has not changed from firefox-ios, beyond the
//! change to store timestamps as milliseconds explained in [COMMON_COLS].
//!
//! Also like `loginsL`, `loginsM` is not guaranteed to have rows for all
//! records. It should not have rows for records which were not synced!
//!
//! It is important to note that `loginsL` is not guaranteed to be present for
//! all records. Synced records may only exist in `loginsM`! Queries should
//! test against both!
//!
//! ### `loginsM` Columns
//!
//! Contains all fields in [COMMON_COLS], as well as the following additional
//! columns:
//!
//! - `server_modified`: the most recent server-modification timestamp
//!   ([sync15::ServerTimestamp]) we've seen for this record. Stored as
//!   a millisecond value.
//!
//! - `is_overridden`: A boolean indicating whether or not the mirror contents
//!   are invalid, and that we should defer to the data stored in `loginsL`.
//!
//! ## `loginsSyncMeta`
//!
//! This is a simple key-value table based on the `moz_meta` table in places.
//! This table was added (by this rust crate) in version 4, and so is not
//! present in firefox-ios.
//!
//! Currently it is used to store two items:
//!
//! 1. The last sync timestamp is stored under [LAST_SYNC_META_KEY], a
//!    `sync15::ServerTimestamp` stored in integer milliseconds.
//!
//! 2. The persisted sync state machine information is stored under
//!    [GLOBAL_STATE_META_KEY]. This is a `sync15::GlobalState` stored as
//!    JSON.
//!

/// `timePasswordChanged`/`timeCreated` timestamps.
