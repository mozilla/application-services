//! # Token Management
//!
//! A signed-in application will typically hold a number of different *tokens* associated with the
//! user's account, including:
//!
//!    - An OAuth `refresh_token`, representing their ongoing connection to the account
//!      and the scopes that have been granted.
//!    - Short-lived OAuth `access_token`s that can be used to access resources on behalf
//!      of the user.
//!    - Optionally, a `session_token` that gives full control over the user's account,
//!      typically managed on behalf of web content that runs within the context
//!      of the application.
