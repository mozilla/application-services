//! # Device Management
//!
//! Applications that connect to a user's account may register additional information
//! about themselves via a "device record", which allows them to:
//!
//!    - customize how they appear in the user's account management page
//!    - receive push notifications about events that happen on the account
//!    - participate in the FxA "device commands" ecosystem
//!
//! For more details on FxA device registration and management, consult the
//! [Firefox Accounts Device Registration docs](
//! https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/blob/main/packages/fxa-auth-server/docs/device_registration.md).
