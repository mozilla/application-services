//! # Migration Support Methods
//!
//! Some applications may have existing signed-in account state from a bespoke implementation
//! of the Firefox Accounts signin protocol, but want to move to using this component in order
//! to reduce maintenance costs.
//!
//! The sign-in state for a legacy FxA integration would typically consist of a session token
//! and a pair of cryptographic keys used for accessing Firefox Sync. The methods in this section
//! can be used to help migrate from such legacy state into state that's suitable for use with
//! this component.

use error_support::handle_error;

impl FirefoxAccount {
    /// Sign in by using legacy session-token state.
    ///
    /// **ðŸ’¾ This method alters the persisted account state.**
    ///
    /// When migrating to use the FxA client component, create a [`FirefoxAccount`] instance
    /// and then pass any legacy sign-in state to this method. It will attempt to use the
    /// session token to bootstrap a full internal state of OAuth tokens, and will store the
    /// provided credentials internally in case it needs to retry after e.g. a network failure.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    ///    - `session_token` - the session token from legacy sign-in state
    ///    - `k_sync` - the Firefox Sync encryption key from legacy sign-in state
    ///    - `k_xcs` - the Firefox Sync "X-Client-State: value from legacy sign-in state
    ///    - `copy_session_token` - if true, copy the given session token rather than using it directly
    ///
    /// # Notes
    ///
    ///    - If successful, this method will return an [`FxAMigrationResult`] with some statistics
    ///      about the migration process.
    ///    - If unsuccessful this method will throw an error, but you may be able to retry the
    ///      migration again at a later time.
    ///    - Use [is_in_migration_state](FirefoxAccount::is_in_migration_state) to check whether the
    ///      persisted account state includes a pending migration that can be retried.
