//! # Account Management URLs
//!
//! Signed-in applications should not attempt to perform an account-level management
//! (such as changing profile data or managing devices) using native UI. Instead, they
//! should offer the user the opportunity to visit their account management pages on the
//! web.
//!
//! The methods in this section provide URLs at which the user can perform various
//! account-management activities.
