//! # Firefox Accounts Client
//!
//! The fxa-client component lets applications integrate with the
//! [Firefox Accounts](https://mozilla.github.io/ecosystem-platform/docs/features/firefox-accounts/fxa-overview)
//! identity service. The shape of a typical integration would look
//! something like:
//!
//! * Out-of-band, register your application with the Firefox Accounts service,
//!   providing an OAuth `redirect_uri` controlled by your application and
//!   obtaining an OAuth `client_id`.
//!
//! * On application startup, create a [`FirefoxAccount`] object to represent the
//!   signed-in state of the application.
//!     * On first startup, a new [`FirefoxAccount`] can be created by calling
//!       [`FirefoxAccount::new`] and passing the application's `client_id`.
//!     * For subsequent startups the object can be persisted using the
//!       [`to_json`](FirefoxAccount::to_json) method and re-created by
//!       calling [`FirefoxAccount::from_json`].
//!
//! * When the user wants to sign in to your application, direct them through
//!   a web-based OAuth flow using [`begin_oauth_flow`](FirefoxAccount::begin_oauth_flow)
//!   or [`begin_pairing_flow`](FirefoxAccount::begin_pairing_flow); when they return
//!   to your registered `redirect_uri`, pass the resulting authorization state back to
//!   [`complete_oauth_flow`](FirefoxAccount::complete_oauth_flow) to sign them in.
//!
//! * Display information about the signed-in user by using the data from
//!   [`get_profile`](FirefoxAccount::get_profile).
//!
//! * Access account-related services on behalf of the user by obtaining OAuth
//!   access tokens via [`get_access_token`](FirefoxAccount::get_access_token).
//!
//! * If the user opts to sign out of the application, calling [`disconnect`](FirefoxAccount::disconnect)
//!   and then discarding any persisted account data.
