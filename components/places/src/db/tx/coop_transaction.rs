//! This implements "cooperative transactions" for places. It relies on our
//! decision to have exactly 1 general purpose "writer" connection and exactly
//! one "sync writer" - ie, exactly 2 write connections.
//!
//! We'll describe the implementation and strategy, but note that most callers
//! should use `PlacesDb::begin_transaction()`, which will do the right thing
//! for your db type.
//!
//! The idea is that anything that uses the sync connection should use
//! `chunked_coop_trransaction`. Code using this should regularly call
//! `maybe_commit()`, and every second, will commit the transaction and start
//! a new one.
//!
//! This means that in theory the other writable connection can start
//! transactions and should block for a max of 1 second - well under the 5
//! seconds before that other writer will fail with a SQLITE_BUSY or similar error.
//!
//! However, in practice we see the writer thread being starved - even though
//! it's waiting for a lock, the sync thread still manages to re-get the lock.
//! In other words, the locks used by sqlite aren't "fair".
//!
//! So we mitigate this with a simple approach that works fine within our
//! "exactly 2 writers" constraints:
//! * Each database connection shares a mutex.
//! * Before starting a transaction, each connection locks the mutex.
//! * It then starts an "immediate" transaction - because sqlite now holds a
//!   lock on our behalf, we release the lock on the mutex.
//!
//! In other words, the lock is held only while obtaining the DB lock, then
//! immediately released.
//!
//! The end result here is that if either connection is waiting for the
//! database lock because the other already holds it, the waiting one is
//! guaranteed to get the database lock next.
//!
//! One additional wrinkle here is that even if there was exactly one writer,
//! there's still a possibility of SQLITE_BUSY if the database is being
//! checkpointed. So we handle that case and perform exactly 1 retry.

/// integrity.) Examples of this might be for performance when updating a larger
/// number of rows, but data integrity concerns could be addressed by using
/// multiple, smaller transactions.
///
/// You should regularly call .maybe_commit() as part of your
/// processing, and if the current transaction has been open for greater than
/// some duration the transaction will be committed and another one
/// started. You should always call .commit() at the end. Note that there is

/// explicitly roll-back, this probably isn't what you should be using. Note
/// that SQLite might rollback for its own reasons though.
///
/// Note that this can still be used for transactions which ensure data
/// integrity. For example, if you are processing a large group of items, and
/// each individual item requires multiple updates, you will probably want to
/// ensure you call .maybe_commit() after every item rather than after
