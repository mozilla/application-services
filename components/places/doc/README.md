# Readme

This is where stand-alone documentation for the places module lives.

Note however that cargo doesn't support external documentation yet, but if
we use something like `cargo-external-doc` is could. However, even without
support for including these docs in the generated doc output, it's still
valuable to have a place where we can collect notes about decisions which
don't naturally fit inline in the code.
