-- The next several triggers are a workaround for the lack of FOR EACH STATEMENT
-- in Sqlite, (see bug 871908).
--
-- While doing inserts or deletes into moz_places, we accumulate the affected
-- origins into a temp table. Afterwards, we delete everything from the temp
-- table, causing the AFTER DELETE trigger to fire for it, which will then
-- update moz_origins and the origin frecency stats. As a consequence, we also
-- do this for updates to moz_places.frecency in order to make sure that changes
-- to origins are serialized.
--
-- Note this way we lose atomicity, crashing between the 2 queries may break the
-- tables' coherency. So it's better to run those DELETE queries in a single
-- transaction. Regardless, this is still better than hanging the browser for
-- several minutes on a fast machine.

-- Note: unlike the version of this trigger in desktop places, we don't bother with calling
-- store_last_inserted_id. Bug comments indicate that's only really needed because the hybrid
-- sync/async connection places prevents `last_insert_rowid` from working. This shouldn't be an
-- issue for us, and it's unclear how we'd implement `store_last_inserted_id` it while supporting
-- multiple connections to separate databases open simultaneously, which we'd like for testing
-- purposes. (To be clear, it's certainly possible to implement it if it turns out we need it, it
-- would just be very tricky).
