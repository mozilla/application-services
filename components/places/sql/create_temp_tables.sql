-- This table is used, along with moz_places_afterinsert_trigger, to update

-- accumulated in this table, then a DELETE FROM moz_updateoriginsinsert_temp
-- will take care of updating the moz_origins table for every new origin. See
-- CREATE_PLACES_AFTERINSERT_TRIGGER_ORIGINS below for details.

-- This table is used (along with moz_updateoriginsupdate_temp) in a similar way
