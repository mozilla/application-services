# This file defines the metrics that will be gathered for the "places" storage component.
# These are emitted for all users of the component.  Additional metrics specific to the
# *syncing* of places are defined in a separate "sync_ping" package.
#
# Changes to these metrics require data review, which should take into consideration
# the following known consumers of the places component Android bindings:
#
#  * Firefox Preview??
#  * Firefox Lockwise for Android??

places_store:

  read_query_count:
    type: counter
    description: >
      The total number of read operations performed on the places store.
      The count only includes operations triggered by the application, not e.g. incidental reads performed
      as part of a sync. It is intended to be used together with `read_query_error_count` to measure the
      overall error rate of read operations on the places store.

      of read operations on the places store.
