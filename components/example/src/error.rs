//! Error handling for the component.
//!
//! Components generally create 2 error enums: one for internal usage and one for the public APIs.
//! The internal errors can have lots of variants and store any details that you might want to use.
//! The public errors can limit the number of variants to the ones consumers actually care about.
//!
//! In general, the Rust code will use the internal errors.  The public API, defined in `lib.rs`,
//! converts internal errors to public errors.
