/// For a number of reasons (name collisions are a big one, but, it also wouldn't work on all
/// platforms), we cannot export `extern "C"` functions from this library. However, it's pretty
/// common to want to free strings allocated by rust, so many libraries will need this, so we
/// provide it as a macro.
///
/// It simply expands to a `#[no_mangle] pub unsafe extern "C" fn` which wraps this crate's
/// [`destroy_c_string`] function.
///
/// ## Caveats
///
/// If you're using multiple separately compiled rust libraries in your application, it's critical
/// that you are careful to only ever free strings allocated by a Rust library using the same rust
/// library. Passing them to a different Rust library's string destructor will cause you to corrupt
/// multiple heaps.
///
/// Additionally, be sure that all strings you pass to this were actually allocated by rust. It's a
/// common issue for JNA code to transparently convert Pointers to things to Strings behind the
/// scenes, which is quite risky here. (To avoid this in JNA, only use `String` for passing
/// read-only strings into Rust, e.g. it's for passing `*const c_char`. All other uses should use
/// `Pointer` and `getString()`).
///
/// Finally, to avoid name collisions, it is strongly recommended that you provide an name for this
/// function unique to your library.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ffi_support::define_string_destructor;
/// define_string_destructor!(mylib_destroy_string);
/// ```
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! define_string_destructor {

/// Define a (public) destructor for a type that was allocated by `Box::into_raw(Box::new(value))`
/// (e.g. a pointer which is probably opaque).
///
/// ## Caveats
///
/// This can go wrong in a ridiculous number of ways, and we can't really prevent any of them. But
/// essentially, the caller (on the other side of the FFI) needs to be extremely careful to ensure
/// that it stops using the pointer after it's freed.
///
/// Also, to avoid name collisions, it is strongly recommended that you provide an name for this
/// function unique to your library. (This is true for all functions you expose).
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ffi_support::define_box_destructor;
/// struct CoolType(Vec<i32>);
///
/// define_box_destructor!(CoolType, mylib_destroy_cooltype);
