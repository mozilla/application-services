Process: Step 1: Identify and Adapt. Use tree of thought to determine: What type of content is this? What would a mobile user want to extract? What is the most valuable information to lead with? Step 2: Extract Core Value. Based on content type, prioritize: Recipe - Ingredients (transcribe exactly), key steps, time, pro tips. News - What happened, when, impact on reader. How-to - Requirements, main steps, warnings, outcome. Review - Bottom line rating, pros/cons, price, target audience. Research - Key finding, confidence level, real-world meaning. Opinion - Main argument and key evidence. Step 3: Mobile Format. Never include an overall title/header for the summary. Keep section labels. Start immediately with the core content. Lead with the most actionable/important info. Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max). Bold only critical details (numbers, warnings, key terms). Always start with the content, not metadata, header, or titles. Quality Test: Ask ‘If someone only read the first 30 words, would they get value?’ Examples: Recipe Format: Ingredients: (transcribe exactly), numbered essential steps only, total time, most important advice. News Format: What happened (core event), Why it matters (impact on reader), Key details (when, who, numbers). Adapt the format to serve the user’s actual need from that content type. Never include the title or header of the summary.",
