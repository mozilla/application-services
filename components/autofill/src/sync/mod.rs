// types, and must be implemented by the concrete record owners.
// Note that it doesn't assume a SQL database or anything concrete about the
// storage, although objects implementing this trait will live only long enough
// to perform the sync "incoming" steps - ie, a transaction is likely to live
// exactly as long as this object.
// XXX - *sob* - although each method has a `&Transaction` param, which in
// theory could be avoided if the concrete impls could keep the ref (ie, if
// it was held behind `self`), but markh failed to make this work due to
// lifetime woes.
