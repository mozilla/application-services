//! # Rust Push Component
//!
//! This component helps an application to manage [WebPush](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API) subscriptions,
//! acting as an intermediary between Mozilla's [autopush service](https://autopush.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
//! and platform native push infrastructure such as [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) or [Amazon Device Messaging](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/adm/overview.html).
//!
//! ## Background Concepts
//!
//! ### WebPush Subscriptions
//!
//! A WebPush client manages a number of *subscriptions*, each of which is used to deliver push
//! notifications to a different part of the app. For example, a web browser might manage a separate
//! subscription for each website that has registered a [service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API), and an application that includes Firefox Accounts would manage
//! a dedicated subscription on which to receive account state updates.
//!
//! Each subscription is identified by a unique *channel id*, which is a randomly-generated identifier.
//! It's the responsibility of the application to know how to map a channel id to an appropriate function
//! in the app to receive push notifications. Subscriptions also have an associated *scope* which is something
//! to do which service workers that your humble author doesn't really understand :-/.
//!
//! When a subscription is created for a channel id, we allocate *subscription info* consisting of:
//!
//! * An HTTP endpoint URL at which push messages can be submitted.
//! * A cryptographic key and authentication secret with which push messages can be encrypted.
//!
//! This subscription info is distributed to other services that want to send push messages to
//! the application.
//!
//! The HTTP endpoint is provided by Mozilla's [autopush service](https://autopush.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
//! and we use the [rust-ece](https://github.com/mozilla/rust-ece) to manage encryption with the cryptographic keys.
//!
//! Here's a helpful diagram of how the *subscription* flow works at a high level across the moving parts:
//! ![A Sequence diagram showing how the different parts of push interact](https://mozilla.github.io/application-services/book/diagrams/Push-Component-Subscription-flow.png "Sequence diagram")
//!
//! ### AutoPush Bridging
//!
//! Our target consumer platforms each have their own proprietary push-notification infrastructure,
//! such as [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) for Android
//! and the [Apple Push Notification Service](https://developer.apple.com/notifications/) for iOS.
//! Mozilla's [autopush service](https://autopush.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides a bridge between
//! these different mechanisms and the WebPush standard so that they can be used with a consistent
//! interface.
//!
//! This component acts a client of the [Push Service Bridge HTTP Interface](https://autopush.readthedocs.io/en/latest/http.html#push-service-bridge-http-interface).
//!
//! We assume two things about the consuming application:
//! * It has registered with the autopush service and received a unique `app_id` identifying this registration.
//! * It has registred with whatever platform-specific notification infrastructure is appropriate, and is
//!   able to obtain a `token` corresponding to its native push notification state.
//!
//! On first use, this component will register itself as an *application instance* with the autopush service, providing the `app_id` and `token` and receiving a unique `uaid` ("user-agent id") to identify its
//! connection to the server.
//!
//! As the application adds or removes subscriptions using the API of this component, it will:
//! * Manage a local database of subscriptions and the corresponding cryptographic material.
//! * Make corresponding HTTP API calls to update the state associated with its `uaid` on the autopush server.
//!
//! Periodically, the application should call a special `verify_connection` method to check whether
//! the state on the autopush server matches the local state and take any corrective action if it
//! differs.
//!
//! For local development and debugging, it is possible to run a local instance of the autopush
//! bridge service; see [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18L_g2hIj_1mncF978A_SHXN4udDQLut5P_ZHYZEwGP8) for details.
//!
//! ## API
//!
//! ## Initialization
//!
//! Calls are handled by the `PushManager`, which provides a handle for future calls.
//!
//! example:
//! ```kotlin
//!
//! import mozilla.appservices.push.(PushManager, BridgeTypes)
//!
//! // The following are mock calls for fetching application level configuration options.
//! // "SenderID" is the native OS push message application identifier. See Native
//! // messaging documentation for details.
//! val sender_id = SystemConfigurationOptions.get("SenderID")
//!
//! // The "bridge type" is the identifier for the native OS push message system.
//! // (e.g. FCM for Google Firebase Cloud Messaging, ADM for Amazon Direct Messaging,
//! // etc.)
//! val bridge_type = BridgeTypes.FCM
//!
//! // The "registration_id" is the native OS push message user registration number.
//! // Native push message registration usually happens at application start, and returns
//! // an opaque user identifier string. See Native messaging documentation for details.
//! val registration_id = NativeMessagingSystem.register(sender_id)
//!
//! val push_manager = PushManager(
//!     sender_id,
//!     bridge_type,
//!     registration_id
//! )
//!
//! // It is strongly encouraged that the connection is verified at least once a day.
//! // This will ensure that the server and UA have matching information regarding
//! // subscriptions. This call usually returns quickly, but may take longer if the
//! // UA has a large number of subscriptions and things have fallen out of sync.
//!
//! for change in push_manager.verify_connection() {
//!     // fetch the subscriber from storage using the change[0] and
//!     // notify them with a `pushsubscriptionchange` message containing the new
//!     // endpoint change[1]
//! }
//!
//! ```
//!
//! ## New subscription
//!
//! Before messages can be delivered, a new subscription must be requested. The subscription info block contains all the information a remote subscription provider service will need to encrypt and transmit a message to this user agent.
//!
//! example:
//! ```kotlin
//!
//! // Each new request must have a unique "channel" identifier. This channel helps
//! // later identify recipients and aid in routing. A ChannelID is a UUID4 value.
//! // the "scope" is the ServiceWorkerRegistration scope. This will be used
//! // later for push notification management.
//! val channelID = GUID.randomUUID()
//!
//! val subscription_info = push_manager.subscribe(channelID, endpoint_scope)
//!
//! // the published subscription info has the following JSON format:
//! // {"endpoint": subscription_info.endpoint,
//! //  "keys": {
//! //      "auth": subscription_info.keys.auth,
//! //      "p256dh": subscription_info.keys.p256dh
//! //  }}
//! ```
//!
//! ## End a subscription
//!
//! A user may decide to no longer receive a given subscription. To remove a given subscription, pass the associated channelID
//!
//! ```kotlin
//! push_manager.unsubscribe(channelID)  // Terminate a single subscription
//! ```
//!
//! If the user wishes to terminate all subscriptions, send and empty string for channelID
//!
//! ```kotlin
//! push_manager.unsubscribe("")        // Terminate all subscriptions for a user
//! ```
//!
//! If this function returns `false` the subsequent `verify_connection` may result in new channel endpoints.
//!
//! ## Decrypt an incoming subscription message
//!
//! An incoming subscription body will contain a number of metadata elements along with the body of the message. Due to platform differences, how that metadata is provided may //! vary, however the most common form is that the messages "payload" looks like.
//!
//! ```javascript
//! {"chid": "...",         // ChannelID
//!  "con": "...",          // Encoding form
//!  "enc": "...",          // Optional encryption header
//!  "crypto-key": "...",   // Optional crypto key header
//!  "body": "...",         // Encrypted message body
//! }
//! ```
//! These fields may be included as a sub-hash, or may be intermingled with other data fields. If you have doubts or concerns, please contact the Application Services team guidance
//!
//! Based on the above payload, an example call might look like:
//!
//! ```kotlin
//!     val result = manager.decrypt(
//!         channelID = payload["chid"].toString(),
//!         body = payload["body"].toString(),
//!         encoding = payload["con"].toString(),
//!         salt = payload.getOrElse("enc", "").toString(),
//!         dh = payload.getOrElse("dh", "").toString()
//!     )
//!     // result returns a byte array. You may need to convert to a string
//!     return result.toString(Charset.forName("UTF-8"))
//!```
