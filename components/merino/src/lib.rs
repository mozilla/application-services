//! This crate is a cross-platform client library for Mozilla's Merino service.
//!
//! It provides two clients:
//!
//! - [`CuratedRecommendationsClient`](curated_recommendations::CuratedRecommendationsClient) —
//!   fetches curated content recommendations (articles, stories) from the Merino backend,
//!   powering features like Firefox's New Tab page.
//!
//! - [`SuggestClient`](suggest::SuggestClient) —
//!   fetches search suggestions from the Merino suggest endpoint,
//!   powering features like Firefox's address bar suggestions.
//!
//! This crate uses [UniFFI](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/) to generate cross-platform
//! bindings for Android and other targets.
