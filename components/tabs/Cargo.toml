# When used in desktop we *do not* want the full-sync implementation so desktop
# doesn't get our crypto etc.
# When used on mobile, for simplicity we *do* still expose the unused "bridged engine"
# because none of the engine implementations need the crypto.
default = []

# TODO: we've enabled the "standalone-sync" feature - see the description
# of this feature in sync15's Cargo.toml for what we should do instead.
# (The short version here is that once tabs doesn't need to expose a `sync()`
# method for iOS, we can kill the `full-sync` feature entirely)
