//! This is a simple HTTP client that uses viaduct to retrieve experiment data from the server.
//! Currently configured to use Kinto and the old schema, although that would change once we start
//! working on the real Nimbus schema.
//!
//! In the future we might replace this with a more fully-feature Remote Settings client, such as:
//!
//!   https://github.com/mozilla-services/remote-settings-client
//!   Issue: https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/issues/3475
//!
//! But the simple subset implemented here meets our needs for now.
