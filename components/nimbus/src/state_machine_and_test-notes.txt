* finish the test james started to look for correct reuse of feature_ids
* read code and think of other key things to test, particularly hard cases
* general cleanup
* ask travis

* integration tests for all 8 evolve_experiment tuples on evolve_experiments

* unit tests for on_experiment_ended all 5 different enrollment statuses
* integration tests that generates lots of experiments & lots of enrollments
