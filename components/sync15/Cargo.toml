# The default feature is what mozilla-central wants (we are listed in a `[patch]` section in
# in m-c's top-level Cargo.toml to make updating easier, but you can't specify features there)

# Some consumers of this just need our encrypted payloads and no other sync functionality.
crypto = ["rc_crypto", "base16", "base64"]

# Some crates need to implement a "sync engine", but aren't a "sync client" (ie, their
# engine is used by a "sync client".) Engines don't interact directly with the storage servers,
# nor do they do their own crypto.
# See the rustdocs in `crate::engine` for more information about engines.
sync-engine = ["random-guid"]

# Some crates are a "sync client" and do full management/initialization of server storage,
# keys, etc and sync one or more engines. This crate has an engine to manage the "clients"
# collection, so needs the sync-engine feature.
# See the rustdocs in `crate::client` for more information about clients.
sync-client = ["sync-engine", "crypto", "viaduct", "url"]

# Some crates just do their own engine but need to pretend they are a client,
# eg, iOS pre-sync-manager.
# Consider places:
# * It always is going to need to supply a "sync-engine".
# * When used in iOS, due to the lack of sync_manager support, it also needs to
#   supply a kind of "sync-client". It is *not* necessary to supply this for Android.
# In a perfect world:
# * places would also have a feature called, say, "sync-client"
# * The code needed for iOS would be behind the "sync-client" feature.
# * The ios megazord would enable the "sync-client" feature, but the android megazord would not.
#
# However, that's not yet the case. This "stand-alone" sync feature is used by crates
# such as places, and is really a marker to help identify the crates which should be
# upgraded to make the sync-client part truly optional.
