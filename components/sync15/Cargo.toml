# Some libraries need to implement a "sync engine", but aren't a "sync client" (ie, their
# engine is used by an external "sync client", like on desktop).
# Engines don't interact directly with the storage servers, nor do they do their own crypto.
# See the rustdocs in `crate::engine` for more information about engines.

# Some libraries are a "sync client" and do full management/initialization of server storage,
# keys, etc and sync one or more engines. This feature will enable this crate to have a `clients`
# engine to manage state in the `clients` collection - thus, it requires the `sync-engine` feature.
# See the rustdocs in `crate::client` for more information about clients.
