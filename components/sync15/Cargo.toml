# Some crates need to implement a "sync engine", but aren't a "sync client" (ie, their
# engine is used by a "sync client".) Engines don't interact directly with the storage servers,
# nor do they do their own crypto.
sync-engine = ["random-guid"]

# Some crates are a "sync client" and do full management/initialization of server storage,
# keys, etc and sync one or more engines. This crate has an engine to manage the "clients"
# collection, so needs the sync-engine feature.

# Some crates just do their own engine but need to pretend they are a client,
# eg, iOS pre-sync-manager.
# This feature should die and become "sync-engine" - this feature exists as a
# marker to help identify what we should trim when stand-alone syncing is not needed.
