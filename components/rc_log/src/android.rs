//! This is the android backend for rc_log. It has a decent amount of
//! complexity, as Rust logs can be emitted by any thread, regardless of whether
//! or not they have an associated JVM thread. JNA's Callback class helps us
//! here, by providing a way for mapping native threads to JVM threads.
//! Unfortunately, naive usage of this class in a multithreaded context will be
//! very suboptimal in terms of memory and thread usage.
//!
//! To avoid this, we only call into the JVM from a single thread, which we
//! launch when initializing the logger. This thread just polls a channel
//! listening for log messages, where a log message is an enum (`LogMessage`)
//! that either tells it to log an item, or to stop logging all together.
//!
//! 1. We cannot guarantee that the callback from android lives past when the
//!    android code tells us to stop logging, so in order to be memory safe, we
//!    need to stop logging immediately when this happens. We do this using an
//!    `Arc<AtomicBool>`, used to indicate that we should stop logging.
//!
//! 2. There's no safe way to terminate a thread in Rust (for good reason), so
//!    the background thread must close willingly. To make sure this happens
//!    promptly (e.g. to avoid a case where we're blocked until some thread
//!    somewhere else happens to log something), we need to add something onto
//!    the log channel, hence the existence of `LogMessage::Stop`.
//!
//!    It's important to note that because of point 1, the polling thread may
//!    have to stop prior to getting `LogMessage::Stop`. We do not want to wait
//!    for it to process whatever log messages were sent prior to being told to
//!    stop.
