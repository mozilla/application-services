Hi All,

On September 24th, we shipped FxA train-121 to production,
with the following highlights:

<!--truncate-->

## FxA-0: quality

Every train we pay down a little technical debt, this train is no exception.
This train we stopped reporting metrics to DataDog, fixed several
flaky tests, removed unused code, and ensured that firefox.com email
addresses cannot be used in the "email-first" flow.

## FxA-153: Account recovery

A couple of small account recovery fixes were shipped, with us
comfortable enough to enable the feature for 10% of users.

## FxA-155: signin papercuts

to sign in using 2FA.

## FxA-156: Fenix Pairing flow

The Fenix pairing flow work continues. This train was only
groundwork, with one pet mini-project of mine landing. We
now have the ability to load views on demand instead of
expanding the main bundle for each new view.
