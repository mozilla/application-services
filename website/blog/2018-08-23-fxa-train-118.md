Hi All,

On Aug 14th we shipped FxA train-118 to production,
with the following highlights:

<!--truncate-->

## FxA-0: quality

It's a lot of work to keep a busy service running, "Quality"
work ensures we are able to.

Some highlights:
* Several repos were updated to use the "Circle 2.0" CI version
since 1.0 is being deprecated at the end of the month.
* The content server has been updated to use Webpack 4.0
* CSS is now built using Webpack and "grunt watch:sass" is no longer needed
* Tests are more stable
* OAuth scope checking across all repos is done using the same library.

## FxA-141: lockbox beta

Lockbox wants to use the "email first" flow but there was an
error in the flow that always forced users who were already
signed in to enter their password again.
