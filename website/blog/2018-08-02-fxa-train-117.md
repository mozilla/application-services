Hi All,

This week we shipped FxA train-117 to production,
with the following highlights:

<!--truncate-->


## FxA-0: quality

General code quality improvements and bug squashing
is a continual process. This train is no exception.

A couple of visual changes: FxA's checkbox now
use the "Photon" styling, and TOTP should be
easier to use on mobile after shrinking that
screen's icon.

Several repos were updated to migrate from
Circle 1.0 to 2.0.
