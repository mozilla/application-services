Hi All,

with the following highlights:

<!--truncate-->

## FxA-0: quality

## FxA-149: GDPR

We are preparing to deprecate the [fxa-basket-proxy](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-basket-proxy/)
and instead are going to send messages directly to Basket. In preparation, the content server was
updated to send requests to the basket-proxy using the same format expected by basket. We also
updated messaging when a user deletes their account to inform them the user must first delete
their data on attached servicse.

## FxA-152: Improve password strength

Many styling changes were merged to bring FxA up to date with
the Photon spec. Highlights include using system fonts instead
of Fira, the "Show password" label has been updated to show
an "eye" icon, tooltips are always placed above input elements
on mobile, the age input element only shows the numeric keypad
on iOS, the signin flow has an entirely new look, and many
color changes.

## FxA-154: Release TOTP

The soft launch of TOTP uncovered a couple of issues that were
fixed, including requiring a TOTP verified session to
change a password, notifying users when they run low on
recovery codes, and finally, releasing the TOTP experiment
to 10% of users.
