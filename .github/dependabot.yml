# Our dependency management is a little complicated, because anything we take 
# as a dependency in this repo will eventually need to be vendored into mozilla-central.
# We're still working on the policy details of how to manage that, and in the meantime
# we can't just take version bumps arbitrarily. So, disable dependabot pending a more
# nuanced policy here.
#
# See https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/issues/3809 for some discussion.
#
# Note that we have a separate CI task that runs `cargo audit` to warn us about
# dependencies that have security vulnerabilities.
