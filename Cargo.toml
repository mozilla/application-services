# The `default-members` are the things that are built/tested when you run `cargo
# build`, `cargo test` (or most of the cargo commands not provided by a
# third-party `cargo-foo` binary) from a workspace root *without* doing one of:
#
# - Specifying a specific package (e.g. via `-p <package>`, `--manifest-dir
#   <path>` ...)
#
# - Passing `--workspace` or `--all`.
#
# - Running the command from within that package (e.g. running `cargo build`
#   inside `megazords/full` will build the full megazord, default or not).
#
# We use this to exclude a couple that have a disproportional compile time
# impact to how likely they are to get broken by average changes:
#
# - `nss_sys`'s companion test crate `systest` adds `syntex_syntax2` which is
#   (surprisingly) by far the slowest crate to build in our dep graph, and very
#   very rarely needs changing
#
# - The megazords just re-export ffi crates, which we aren't excluding, and get
#   built freqently enough as part of gradle/xcode's build process.
#
# To be clear: passing the `--all` or `--workspace` arg to cargo will make it
# use the full member set.
