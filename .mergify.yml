      # and also that there are no other checks in unexpected states.

      # and mergify respects these rules, so the expected behaviour here is that mergify will only
      # merge when it can cleanly put the exact commits of the PR directly on top of `main`
      # (and thus avoid having to re-write any commits or create merge commits of its own).
