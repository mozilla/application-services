/// ABI stable! It needs to take no arguments, and return either null, or a
/// NUL-terminated C string. Failure to do this will result in memory unsafety
/// when an old version of the megazord loader loads a newer library!

/// If we ever need to change that (which seems unlikely, since we could encode
/// whatever we want in a string if it came to it), we must change the functions
