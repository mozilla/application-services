# This is a bit of a mess. It appears we get rusqlite=bundled as a side-effect of
# none of the rc_crypto consumers *not* using the `gecko` feature in that crate.
# If we wanted to *avoid* the bundled sqlite here we'd need to use the `in_gecko` feature of rusqlite.
# In an ideal world, it seems we should be required to use `features=["bundled]` for rusqlite here.
# (But for now we want to ship our sqlite for Android, so don't need to do anything here currently)
