## Motivation

The **Firefox Accounts Android Component** provides a way for Android applications to do the following:

* Obtain OAuth tokens that can be used to access the user's data in Mozilla-hosted services like Firefox Sync
* Fetch client-side scoped keys needed for end-to-end encryption of that data
* Fetch a user's profile to personalize the application

See the [android component documentation](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/tree/master/components/service/firefox-accounts), as well as the [sample app](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/tree/master/samples/firefox-accounts)
for help with integrating this component into your application.
