Welcome to the developer home of Firefox Sync. For non-technical
information, please see [the official Sync web
site](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/sync/).

Firefox Sync is a service for syncing bookmarks, history,
passwords, and other profile data across Mozilla products. The
Sync service includes **clients**, which are integrated in Firefox
Desktop, Firefox for Android, and Firefox for iOS, and **servers**,
which store encrypted blobs of synced data.

The code and specifications for the clients and servers are all
public, meaning that others are free to implement components or run
Sync on their own. By default, Firefox uses the Sync server stack
hosted by Mozilla. The [storage server
documentation](https://mozilla-services.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
covers the Sync HTTP server API, cryptography model, daa storage
formats, and how to run your own server.

### Report Bugs

Sync bugs should be reported in the [Firefox :: Sync component](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&component=Sync)
on Bugzilla. Check out our [guide to filing a Desktop bug](sync/file-desktop-bug.md)
for more details.
