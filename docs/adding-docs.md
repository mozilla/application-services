# Developing documentation

The documentation in this repository pertains to the application-services library, primarily the sync and storage components, firefox account client and the nimbus-sdk experimentation client.

The markdown is converted to static HTML using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).  To add a new document, you need to add it to the SUMMARY.md file which produces the sidebar table of contents.
