# Application Services Release Process

## Nightly builds

Nightly builds are automatically generated using a taskcluster cron task.

- The results of the latest successful nightly build is listed here:
  https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/tasks/index/project.application-services.v2.nightly/latest
- The latest nightly decision task should be listed here:
  https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/tasks/index/project.application-services.v2.branch.main.latest.taskgraph/decision-nightly
- If you don't see a decision task from the day before, then contact releng.  It's likely that the cron decision task is broken.

## Release builds

Release builds are generated from the `release-vXXX` branches and triggered in Ship-it

- Whenever a commit is pushed to a release branch, we build candidate artifacts. These artifacts are
  shippable -- if we decide that the release is ready, they just need to be copied to the correct
  location.
- The `push` phase of `release-promotion` copies the candidate to a staging location where they can
  be tested.
- The `ship` phase of `release-promotion` copies the candidate to their final, published, location.

## [Release management] Creating a new release
> This part is 100% covered by the Release Management team. The dev team should not perform these steps.

On Merge Day we take a snapshot of the current `main`, and prepare a release. See [Firefox Release Calendar](https://whattrainisitnow.com/calendar/).

1. Create a branch name with the format `releases-v[release_version]` off of the `main` branch (for example, `release-v118`) through the GitHub UI.
`[release_version]` should follow the Firefox release number. See [Firefox Release Calendar](https://whattrainisitnow.com/calendar/).

2. Create a PR against the release branch that updates `version.txt` and updates the `CHANGELOG.md` as follows:
  * In [version.txt](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/blob/main/version.txt), update the version from [release_version].0a1 to [release_version].0. 
```diff
diff --git a/version.txt b/version.txt
--- a/version.txt
+++ b/version.txt
@@ -1 +1 @@
-118.0a1
+118.0
```
  * In [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), change `In progress` to `_YYYY-MM-DD_` to match the Merge Day date and add a URL to the release version change log.

 ### 🦊 What's Changed 🦊
 
 - Backward-incompatible changes to the Suggest database schema to accommodate custom details for providers ([#5745](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5745)) and future suggestion types ([#5766](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5766)). This only affects prototyping, because we aren't consuming Suggest in any of our products yet.

 - The Remote Settings client has a new `Client::get_records_with_options()` method ([#5764](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5764)). This is for Rust consumers only; it's not exposed to Swift or Kotlin.
 - `RemoteSettingsRecord` objects have a new `deleted` property that indicates if the record is a tombstone ([#5764](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5764)).

5. Tag the release in the Application Services repo.

6. Inform the Application Services team to cut a release of [rust-components-swift](https://github.com/mozilla/rust-components-swift)

### [Release management] Creating a new release via scripts:
1. Run `pip3 install -r automation/requirements.txt` to install the required Python packages.
2. Run the `automation/prepare-release.py` script.  This should:
  * Create a new branch named `release-vXXX`
  * Create a PR against that branch that updates `version.txt` like this:

```diff
diff --git a/version.txt b/version.txt
index 8cd923873..6482018e0 100644

-114.0a1
+114.0
```
  * Create a PR on `main` that starts a new CHANGELOG header.

3. Tag the release with `automation/tag-release.py [major-version-number]`



### Cutting patch releases for uplifted changes

If you want to uplift changes into the a previous release:

* Make sure the changes are present in `main` and have been thoroughly tested.
* Checkout the `release-vXXX` branch, where `XXX` is the major version number.
* Bump the version in `version.txt`
* Cherry-pick any commits that you want to uplift
* Create a PR for the changes
* Trigger release-promotion for the branch once the PRs are approved, merged, and CI has completed


# What gets built in a release?

We build several artifacts for both nightlies and releases:
  - `nightly.json` / `release.json`.  This is a JSON file containing metadata from successful
    builds.  The metadata for the latest successful build can be found from a taskcluster index:
    https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/api/index/v1/task/project.application-services.v2.release.latest/artifacts/public%2Fbuild%2Frelease.json
    The JSON file contains:
    - The version number for the nightly/release
    - The git commit ID
    - The maven channel for Kotlin packages:
      - `maven-production`: https://maven.mozilla.org/?prefix=maven2/org/mozilla/appservices/
      - `maven-nightly-production`: https://maven.mozilla.org/?prefix=maven2/org/mozilla/appservices/nightly/
      - `maven-staging`: https://maven-default.stage.mozaws.net/?prefix=maven2/org/mozilla/appservices/
      - `maven-nightly-staging`: https://maven-default.stage.mozaws.net/?prefix=maven2/org/mozilla/appservices/nightly/
    - Links to `nimbus-fml.*`: used to build Firefox/Focus on Android and iOS
    - Links to `*RustComponentsSwift.xcframework.zip`: XCFramework archives used to build Firefox/Focus on iOS
    - Link to `swift-components.tar.xz`: UniFFI-generated swift files which get extracted into the
      `rust-components-swift` repository for each release.

## Nightly builds

For nightly builds, consumers get the artifacts directly from the taskcluster.

  - For, `firefox-android`, the nightlies are handled by [relbot](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/relbot/)
  - For, `firefox-ios`, the nightlies are consumed by [rust-components-swift](https://github.com/mozilla/rust-components-swift).  `rust-components-swift` makes a github release, which is picked up by a Github action in [firefox-ios](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios)

## Release promotion

For real releases, we use the taskcluster release-promotion action.  Release promotion happens in two phases:
  - `promote` copies the artifacts from taskcluster and moves them to a staging area.  This
    allows for testing the consumer apps with the artifacts.
  - `ship` copies the artifacts from the staging area to archive.mozilla.org, which serves as
    their permanent storage area.
