# Adding a new component to Application Services

This is a rapid-fire list for adding a component from scratch and generating Kotlin/Swift bindings.

## The Rust Code

Your component should live under `./components` in this repo.
Use `cargo new --lib ./components/<your_crate_name>`to create a new library crate.

See the [Guide to Building a Rust Component](./building-a-rust-component.md) for general
advice on designing and structuring the actual Rust code, and follow the
[Dependency Management Guidelines](../dependency-management.md) if your crate
introduces any new dependencies.

Use [UniFFI](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/) to define how your crate's
API will get exposed to foreign-language bindings. Lookup the installed uniffi
version on other packages (eg `grep uniffi
components/init_rust_components/Cargo.toml`) and use the same version. Place
the following in your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
uniffi = { version = "<current uniffi version>" }
```

New components should prefer using the
[proc-macro](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/latest/proc_macro/index.html) approach rather than
a UDL file based approach.  If you do use a UDL file, add this to `Cargo.toml` as well.

```
[build-dependencies]
uniffi = { version = "<current uniffi version>" }
```

Include your new crate in the `application-services` workspace, by adding
it to the `members` and `default-members` lists in the `Cargo.toml` at
the root of the repository.

Run `cargo check -p <your_crate_name>` in the repository root to confirm that
things are configured properly. This will also have the side-effect of updating
`Cargo.lock` to contain your new crate and its dependencies.


## The Android Bindings

Run the `cargo start-bindings android <your_crate_name> <component_description>` command to auto-generate the initial code.  Follow the directions in the output.

You will end up with a directory structure something like this:

* `components/<your_crate_name>/`
    * `Cargo.toml`
    * `uniffi.toml`
    * `src/`
        * Rust code here.
    * `android/`
        * `build.gradle`
        * `src/`
          * `main/`
              * `AndroidManifest.xml`

### Dependent crates

If your crate uses types from another crate in it's public API, you need to include a dependency for
the corresponding project in your `android/build.gradle` file.

For example, suppose use the `remote_settings::RemoteSettingsServer` type in your public API so that
consumers can select which server they want.  In that case, you need to a dependency on the
remotesettings project:

```
dependencies {
    api project(":remotesettings")
}
```

### Async dependencies

If your components exports async functions, add the following to your `android/build.gradle` file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation libs.kotlin.coroutines
}
```

### Hand-written code

You can include hand-written Kotlin code alongside the automatically
generated bindings, by placing `.kt`` files in a directory named:
* `./android/src/test/java/mozilla/appservices/<your_crate_name>/`

You can write Kotlin-level tests that consume your component's API,
by placing `.kt`` files in a directory named:
* `./android/src/test/java/mozilla/appservices/<your_crate_name>/`.

You can run the tests with `./gradlew <your_crate_name>:test`

## The iOS Bindings

* Run the `cargo start-bindings ios <your_crate_name>` command to auto-generate the initial code
* Run `cargo start-bindings ios-focus <your_crate_name>` if you also want to expose your component to Focus.
* Follow the directions in the output.


You will end up with a directory structure something like this:

* `components/<your_crate_name>/`
    * `Cargo.toml`
    * `uniffi.toml`
    * `src/`
        * Rust code here.

### Adding your component to the Swift Package Megazord

> *For more information on our how we ship components using the Swift Package Manager, check the [ADR that introduced the Swift Package Manager](../adr/0003-swift-packaging.md)*

Add your component into the iOS ["megazord"](../design/megazords.md) through the local Swift Package Manager (SPM) package `MozillaRustComponentsWrapper`. Note this SPM is for easy of local testing of APIs locally. The official SPM that is consumed by firefox-ios is [rust-components-swift](https://github.com/mozilla/rust-components-swift?tab=readme-ov-file).

1. Place any hand-written Swift wrapper code for your component in:
   ```
   megazords/ios-rust/sources/MozillaRustComponentsWrapper/<your_crate_name>/
   ```

2. Place your Swift test code in:
   ```
   megazords/ios-rust/tests/MozillaRustComponentsWrapper/
   ```

That's it! At this point, if you don't intend on writing tests _(are you sure?)_ you can skip this next section.

### Writing and Running Tests

The current system combines all rust crates into one binary (megazord). To use your rust APIs simply
import the local SPM into your tests:

```swift
@testable import MozillaRustComponentsWrapper
```

To test your component:

- Run the script:

```
./automation/run_ios_tests.sh
```

The script will:
1. Build the XCFramework (combines all rust binaries for SPM)
2. Generate UniFFi bindings (artifacts can be found in `megazords/ios-rust/sources/MozillaRustComponentsWrapper/Generated/`)
3. Generate Glean metrics
4. Run any tests found in the test dir mentioned above

TODO: Update this section??

To ensure distribution of this code, edit `taskcluster/scripts/build-and-test-swift.py`:

- Add your component's directory path to `SOURCE_TO_COPY`
- Optionally, add the path to `FOCUS_SOURCE_TO_COPY` if your component targets Firefox Focus.



Make sure that this code gets distributed. Edit `taskcluster/scripts/build-and-test-swift.py` and:

- Add the path to the directory containing any hand-written swift code to `SOURCE_TO_COPY`
- Optionally also to `FOCUS_SOURCE_TO_COPY` if your component is also targeting Firefox Focus


### Distribute your component with `rust-components-swift`
The Swift source code and generated UniFFI bindings are distributed to consumers (eg: Firefox iOS) through [`rust-components-swift`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust-components-swift).

Your component should now automatically get included in the next `rust-component-swift` nightly release.
