## Firefox Application Services Docs

This directory is the documentation root for all the products managed by the
Firefox Application Services Team.

The [./product-portal/](product-portal) directory contains the source docs for
the consumer-facing product portal website. Everything else in this directory
is contributor-facing documentation to help you work on app-services projects.
