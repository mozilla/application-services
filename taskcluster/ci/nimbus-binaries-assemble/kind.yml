# release-publish: publish artifacts for successful nightly/release builds
#
# This task publishes a JSON file for the nightly/release builds. The JSON file is used by consumer
# apps for app-services version bumps.
#
# This task only runs if build-summary succeeds, which implies that all other
# tasks suceeded.  This task should not fail, since that could leave the
# build artifacts in an inconsistent state.
