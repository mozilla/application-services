# nightly-publish: publish artifacts for successful nightly builds
#
# This task publishes the nightly.json file for the nightly builds.
# nightly.json is used by consumer apps for their nightly app-services version
# bump.
#
# This task only runs if nightly-summary succeeds, which implies that all other
# tasks suceeded.  This task should not fail, since that could leave the
# nightly artifacts in an inconsistent state.
