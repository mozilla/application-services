## Nimbus ‚õÖÔ∏èüî¨üî≠

### What's New
  - New API in the `FeatureHolder`, both iOS and Android to control the output of the `value()` call:
    - to cache the values given to callers; this can be cleared with `FxNimbus.invalidatedCachedValues()`
    - to add a custom initializer with `with(initializer:_)`/`withInitializer(_)`.
## Places
### What's Fixed:
- Fixed a bug in Android where non-fatal errors were crashing. ([#4941](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/4941))
