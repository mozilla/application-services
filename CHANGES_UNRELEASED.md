### What's Changed
 - Added `applyLocalExperiments()` method as short hand for `setLocalExperiments` and `applyPendingExperiments`. ([#5131](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5131))
   - `applyLocalExperiments` and `applyPendingExperiments` now returns a cancellable job which can be used in a timeout.
   - `initialize` function takes a raw resource file id, and returns a cancellable `Job`.

### What's Fixed

   - A regression affecting Android in calculating `days_since_install` and `days_since_update` ([#5157](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5157))
