## Nimbus FML ‚õÖÔ∏èüî¨üî≠üîß

### What's New
  - Added support for breaking up FML files using `includes` and separating into different modules with `imports`.
    ([#5022](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5022), [#5016](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5016), [#5014](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5014), [#5007](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5007), [#4999](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/4999), [#4997](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/4997), [#4976](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/4976))
    - This is _not_ a breaking change, but should be accompanied by a upgrade to the megazord ([#4099](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/4099)).
    - This also deprecates some commands in the command line interface ([#5022](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5022)). These will be removed in a future release.
