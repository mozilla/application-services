## Nimbus ⛅️🔬🔭

### What's New
  - New API in the `FeatureHolder`, both iOS and Android to control the output of the `value()` call:
    - to cache the values given to callers; this can be cleared with `FxNimbus.invalidatedCachedValues()`
    - to add a custom initializer with `with(initializer:_)`/`withInitializer(_)`.
