# Unreleased Changes
## Nimbus
### What's changed
  - Fixed a bug where opt-in enrollments in experiments were not preserved when the application is restarted ([#4324](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/4324))
  - The nimbus component now specifies the version of the server's api - currently V1. That was done to avoid redirects. ([#4319](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/4319))
