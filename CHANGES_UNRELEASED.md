## Push
### What's changed
  - Push internally no longer uses the `error_support` dependency to simplify the code. It now directly defines exactly one error enum and exposes that to `uniffi`. This should have no implication to the consumer code ([#4650](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/4650))
