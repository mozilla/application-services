## Nimbus ⛅️🔬🔭

### ✨ What's New ✨

- Added processing of command line arguments (or intent extras) to be driven by a command line tool. ([#5482](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5482), [#5497](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5497))
  - Requires passing `CommandLine.arguments` to `NimbusBuilder` in iOS.
  - Requires passing `intent` to `NimbusInterface` in Android.
- Added Cirrus client object for working with Nimbus in a static, stateless manner ([#5471](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5471)).
  - Added Cirrus client UDL bindings ([#5475](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5475)).
    - *NOTE:* The Cirrus UDL bindings are only intended to function with Python, additional types should be set in the `uniffi.toml` if another language is needed.
- Added [`nimbus-cli`](./components/support/nimbus-cli). ([#5494](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5494))

## Places ⛅️🔬🔭

### 🦊 What's Changed 🦊

  - Added support for sync payload evolution in history.  If other clients sync history records / visits with fields that we don't know about, we store that data as JSON and send it back when it's synced next.
