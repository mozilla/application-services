## General

### What's Changed

- Android: Upgraded NDK from r21d to r25c.

## Nimbus ‚õÖÔ∏èüî¨üî≠

### ü¶ä What's Changed ü¶ä
- Refactor the `EnrollmentEvolver` in preparation for a larger refactor to split out the `stateful` feature. ([#5374](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5374)).
- Added a `stateful` cargo feature and added appropriate feature flag attributes ([#5448](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5448)).
  - This does not functionally change build processes, as the `stateful` feature is now the default feature for the `nimbus-sdk` library.
- Changed the ordering around for optional arguments for Python compatibility ([#5460](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5460)).
  - This does not change Kotlin or Swift APIs, but affects code that uses the uniffi generated FFI for `record_event` and `record_past_event` directly.
### ‚ú® What's New ‚ú®

- Added more testing tools for the `NimbusEventStore`, for iOS and Android ([#5477](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5477))
  - `events.advanceEventTime(by: time)` lets you queue up a sequence of events to test JEXL queries.
