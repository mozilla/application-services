## Nimbus FML

### What's New
  - The Nimbus FML can now generate swift code for the feature manifest. ([#4780](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/4780))
    - It can be invoked using:
    ```sh
    $ nimbus-fml <FEATURE_MANIFEST_YAML> -o <OUTPUT_NAME> ios features
    ```
    - You can check the support flags and options by running:
    ```sh
    $ nimbus-fml ios --help
    ```
    - The generated code exposes:
      -  a high level nimbus object, whose name is configurable using the `--classname` option. By default the object is `MyNimbus`.
      - All the enums and objects defined in the manifest as idiomatic Swift code.
    - Usage:
      - To access a feature's value:
        ```swift
        // MyNimbus is the class that holds all the features supported by Nimbus
        // MyNimbus has an singleton instance, you can access it using the `shared` field:

        let nimbus = MyNimbus.shared

        // Then you can access the features using:
        // MyNimbus.features.<featureNameCamelCase>.value(), for example:

        let feature = nimbus.features.homepage.value()
        ```
      - To access a field in the feature:
        ```swift
        // feature.<propertyNameCamelCase>, for example:

        assert(feature.sectionsEnabled[HomeScreenSection.topSites] == true)
        ```
