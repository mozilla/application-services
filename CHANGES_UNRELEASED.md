## Logins
### ⚠️ Breaking Changes ⚠️
  - Removed expired logins sqlcipher migration metrics and renamed the `migrateLoginsWithMetrics` function since it no longer reports metrics. An associated iOS PR ([#11470](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/pull/11470)) has been created to address the function renaming. ([#5064](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5064))
