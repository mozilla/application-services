## ‚õÖÔ∏èüî¨üî≠ Nimbus

### ‚ú® What's New ‚ú®
  - `active_experiments` is available to JEXL as a set containing slugs of all enrolled experiments ([#5227](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5227))
  - Added Behavioral Targeting/Display Triggers accessible from JEXL for experiments and messages ([#5226](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5226), [#5228](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5228))
  - Android only: added a new `NimbusBuilder` method to unify Fenix and Focus startup sequences. ([5239](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5239))

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - Changed the type of `customTargetingAttributes` in `NimbusAppSettings` to a `JSONObject`. The change will be breaking only for Android. ([#5229](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5229))
  - Android only: Removed the `initialize()` methods in favor of `NimbusBuilder` class. ([5239](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5239))

## Logins

### What's Changed
  - Include a redacted version of the URL in the Sentry error report when we see a login with an invalid origin field.
  - Made it so `InvalidDatabaseFile` errors aren't reported to Sentry.  These occurs when a non-existent path is passed
    to `migrateLoginsWithMetrics()`, which happens about 1-2 times a day.  This is very low volume, the code is going
    away soon, and we have a plausible theory that these happen when Fenix is killed after the migration but before
    `SQL_CIPHER_MIGRATION` is stored.

## Places

### What's Changed
  - Report a Sentry breadcrumb when we fail to parse URLs, with a redacted version of the URL.

## JwCrypto

### What's Changed
  - Log a breadcrumb with a redacted version of the crypto key when it has an invalid form (before throwing
    DeserializationError)
