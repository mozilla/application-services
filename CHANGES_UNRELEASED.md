## Places
### ⚠️ Breaking Changes ⚠️
- Removed some functions related to sync interruption.  These were never really completed and don't seem to be in use by iOS/Android code:
  - `PlacesApi.new_sync_conn_interrupt_handle()`
  - Swift only: `PlacesAPI.interrupt()`
- The exception variant `InternalPanic` was removed. It's only use was replaced by the already existing `UnexpectedPlacesException`. ([#4847](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/4847))
### What's New
- The Places component will report more error variants to telemetry. ([#4847](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/4847))
## Autofill / Logins / Places / Sync Manager, Webext-Storage
### What's Changed
- Updated interruption handling and added support for shutdown-mode which interrupts all operations.

## Tabs
### ⚠️ Breaking Changes ⚠️

- The tabs component's constructor now requires the path to the database file where remote tabs will be persisted to.
- Requesting remote tabs before the first sync will now return the tabs in this database, so may be "stale".
## Glean
### ⚠️ Breaking Changes ⚠️
### Swift
- GleanMetrics should now be imported under `import Glean` instead of importing via `MozillaRustComponents`
