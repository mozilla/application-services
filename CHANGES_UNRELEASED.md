## Nimbus FML ‚õÖÔ∏èüî¨üî≠üîß
### What's Changed
  - Added `MOZ_APPSERVICES_MODULE` environment variable to specify the megazord module for iOS ([#5042](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5042)). If it is missing, no module is imported.
### ‚ú® What's New ‚ú®
  - Enabled remote loading and using configuring of branches. ([#5041](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5041))
  - Add a `fetch` command to `nimbus-fml` to demo and test remote loading and paths. ([#5047](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/pull/5047))

## Logins
### What's Changed
  - Updated the `LoginsStorageError` implementation and introduce error reporting for unexpected errors.
    Note that some errors were removed, which is technically a breaking change, but none of our
    consumers use those errors so it's not a breaking change in practice.
